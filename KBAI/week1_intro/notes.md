# Week 1 Intro Lecture Notes

## Conundrums in AI

- Intelligent agents have limited resources.
- Computatoin is local, but problems hae global constraints
- Logic is deductive but many problems are not
- The world is dynamic but knowledge is limited.
- Problem solving, reasonig, nd learning are complex but explanation and justification are even more complex

## Characteristics of AI Problems
- Knowledge often arrives incrementally
- Problems exhiibit recurring patterns
- Problems have multiple levels of granularity
- Many problems are computationally intractable
- The world is dynamic but knowledge of the world is static.
- World is open-ended but knowledge is limited.

## Characterstics of AI Agents

- Agents have limited computing power
- Agents have limited sensors
- Agents have lmited attention
- Computatinoally logic is fundamentally deductive
- AI agents knowledge is incomplete relative to the world

## Which of these are AI problems?

x Answering questions on Jeopardy
x Configuring the dimensions for the basement of a new house
x Tying shoelaces
x Deciding on a route to a new destination
x Making sense of a news broadcast
x Designing a robot that walks on water
x Establishing whether a flower pot can be used as a drinking cup
x Deciding whether or not a new animal is a bird


## What is Knowledge-Based AI?

Fundamentals of KBAI

Deliberation: Reasoning, Learning, and Memory are all connected.  We will unify these in building AI.

Foundations: The Four Schools of AI

	      Thinking
Optimally   -    |   -   Like Humans
	      Acting

Which quadrants do these belong?

1 Roomba
2 C-3PO
3 Siri
4 Google Maps

4           Thinking      3
Optimally		Like Humans
1           Acting        2 

Exercise: AI in Practice:  Watson
What are some things Watson must be able to do to participate in Jeopardy?
- Interpret Input.
- React with verbal output.
- 'Think' about what the question is asking for.
- Determine an optimal solution for the question.
- Pick a category based upon existing categories left.
- Answer only when being called and not interrupt others.

Davids answer:

Answer
Phrase Answer in Question

Autonomous Car

Is David right?
  Yes, because an autonomous car mimics ar human behavior
  No, becuase an autonomus car just does the thinking; something else does the acting
x No, becaus eits more important for an autonomous vehicle to act correctly than to act like humans
  No, because an autonomous car just thinks instead of acts, and the thinking isnt even human-like

## What are Cognitive Systems?

Cognitive:  delaing with human-like intelligence
Systems: multiple interacting components such as learning, reaosning, and memory
Cognitive Systems:  Systems that exhibit human-lik inteligence through processes like learning, reasoning, and memory

## Cognitive System Architecture

The world -> Input Cognitive Systems -> Output -> (Back to the World)

## Topics in KBAI

8 Major Units and Organization of the Course

Fundamentals - Semantic Networks, Generate and Test, Production Systems, Mean-End ANalysis, Problem Reduction.  Independent of each other.
Planning - Logic -> Planning
Common Sense Reasoning - Frames -> Undestanding -> Common Sense Reasoning -> Scripts
Learning - Learning by Recording Cases -> Incremental Concrete Learning -> Classification -> Version Spaces
Knowledge Based AI -
Analogical Reasoning - Learning by Recording cases -> Case-Based Reasoning -> Explanation-based Learning -> Analogical Reasoning
Visuospatial Reasoning - Constraining Propagation -> Visuospatial Reasoning
Design & Creativity - Configuration -> Diagnosis -> Design -> Creativity
Metacognition - Learning by correcting mistakes -> metareasoning -> Ethics in AI

## Wrap Up
