## 7 principles

1.  KBAI agents represent and organizer knowledge into knowledge structures to guide and support reasoning.
2.  Learning inKBAI agents is often incremental.
3.  Reasoning in KBAI agents is top-down as well as bottom-up.
4.  KBAI agents match method to tasks.
5.  KBAI agents use huristics to find solutions that are good enough, thogh not ncesarily optimal.
6.  KBAI agents make use of recurring patterns in the problems they solve.
7.  The architecture of KBAI agentts enable reasoning, learning, and memory to support and constrain each other.
