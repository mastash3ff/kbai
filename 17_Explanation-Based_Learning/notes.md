# Explanation-Based Learning

## Exercise: Transporting soup quiz

Which of these might be useful for transporting soup from the kitchen to the table?
-backpack, pitcher, trunk of SUV, cardboard box

Pitcher.

How does a robot know that the pitcher is the best transportation mechanism?  How to make it as easy as it is for humans.

## Example: Retrieving a Cup

Can we provide the described object is a cup?

Cup definition: a cup is an object that is stable and enables drinking.

Object - this object is light and made of porcelain.  It has a decoration, a concavity, and a handle.  The bottom is flat.

Object is Cup?



## Concept Space

Object has bottom, bottom is flat

object made of porcelain.  
Object has decoration.

...

## Prior Knowledge

Brick - stable because its bottom is flat.  a brick is heavy

briefcase - liftable because it has a handle is light.  it is useful because it is a portable container for papers.

glass - enables drinking b/c it carries liquids and is liftable.  it is pretty

bowl - carries liquids because it has concavity.  bowl contains cherry soup.


brick is stable.
brick has bottom.  bottom is flat
brick is heavy.

mapping of causality happens.  a brick is stable because it has a bottom that is flat and it's heavy.

## Abstraction

Only features relevant are pulled out for abstraction.  Agent tries to build a causal explanation.

Bowl carries liquid.  Bowl has concavity

Bowl has cherry soup.

Object carries liquid.  Object has concavity.  Bowl has cherry soup is ignored since it is not relevant.

## Transfer

Object is a cup if it's stable and enables drinking.  Stable and Drinking are stored in memory and are retrieved to pull it's features.  

Problem Reduction and Planning are very similar to the reasoning of explanation-based learning.

## Explanation-Based Learning in the World

To prop open a door, use a chair to stop it.

Find a paper weight to keep papers from flying when wind hits them.

speed up learning is connecting familar concepts.

## Assignment: Explanation-Based Learning

How to use explanation-based learning to answer RPMs?

What exactly are you explaining?  Are you explainign the answer to the problem or explaining the transformations between the figures in the earlier stages of the problem?

What new connections are you learning?  Is learning performed within the problem or old connections justify the figure to fill in the blank or to perform cross problems where problemd learned are connected together.

## Wrap Up

* Concept space - space that allows inferences to be drawn about connections about existing concepts.

* Prior - knowledge mapped onto concept space

* abstraction & transfer - transfer nuggets of information to new problems we encounter - incremental learning.

Analogical reasoning is inheritenantly transfer-based.

## The Cognitive Connection

Expalanation-based learning used all the time in daily life.  the chair prop against door example for instance.

human like intelligence.

huamnss not good at explanation everything.  

AI must generate good explanations that can be accepted by society.  Expalanation is fundamental to trust.
