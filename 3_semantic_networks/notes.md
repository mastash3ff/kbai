## Representations

Knowledge and Repesentation has two things:  Language and Content.  Affordances and constraints.

## Intro to Semantic Networks

Represent Objects as x, y, and z.
Represent relationships between objects by Links which describe the relationship.

Want to capture the knowledge of the transformation from A -> B so that it can be applied to C -> D.

First part deals with objects in A and the objects in B.
Second part deals with relationships between the objects in A and the objects in B.
The third part deals with the relationships between the objects in A and the objects in B.

Capture relationship between A and B in a Raven Matrice.  What has changed?  What has not changed?

## Guards and Prisoners

Appeared in 1200-year-old-text "Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes."
Used by through AI for problem representation.

## Semantic Networks for Guards

Each node is a state that captures how many prisoners/guards are on one side of the boat.
A link goes between node to capture a transition to another state.

## Solving the Guards and Prisoners Problem

Generate all possible moves.  Some are illegal.  Some not productive.

## Represent & Reason for Analogy Problems

If two representations closely match, an answer can be reasonably assumed.

## Assignment:  Semantic Nets

Write a representation scheme.
Talked about how that representation enables problem solving.

Good qualities of a good knowledge representation is that it's complete, it captures information at the right level of abstraction, and enables problem solving.

Semantic network does not capture the solution but the representation of the problem.

## Recap

Knowledge Representations
Semantic Networks - What do they help us do and help us avoid.
Represent and Reason - An abstract class of problem solving that lies at the heart of KBAI.  Simply put, represents knowledge then reasons over it.
Weights with Represent and Reason - Allows us to come to more nuanced and specific conclusions.
