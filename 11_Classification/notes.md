## Concept Learning Revisited

Classifying Birds given pictures.  Accept or Reject pictures if they do or do not meet certain criteria and conditions for being a bird.

## Classifying Birds

Questions asked for classification:
 has wings? has feathers? has talons? has a beak?
 flies? runs?
 lays eggs?
 carivorous? vegarian?
 blue? red?
 swims?
 builds nests?

These are known as percepts.

## The Challenger of Classification

The previous percepts are input into our Cognitive System and it provides an output.

2^n percepts -> 2^m actions possilbe for output

Very, very large amount of percepts and outputs possible which makes the challenge of classification extremely difficult.

10 percepts = 1024 combiniations
100 percepts = 1.2 * 10^30 combinations

Personal observation, NP type of problem.

## Equivalence Classes

One way to solve the ineffeciency presented from the previous section is with Equivalence Classes.

New formula:
  2^n percepts -> k concepts -> 2^m actions possilbe for output

Example, go to the doctor for being sick.  He prescribes a red or blue pill to address some symptoms but does not address all possible combinations of symptoms.

Schools extensively study Classification.

If Equivalence classes were not used, 2^n percepts would be rows and 2^m actions would be columns in a huge table.

## Excercise Equivalence Classes

After providing answers to certain bird criteria such as Eagles lay eggs, they have wings, they do not have fur, etc.  We use this incremental learning approach to build an equivalence class for different types of birds.

## Concept Hierachies

Concept Hierachies relate to incremental learning and background knowledge.

Organization provides power.  Establish a node, refine it.
