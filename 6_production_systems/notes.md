# Production Systems

## Preview

First time talking about learning.
Production systems are kind of a cognitive architecture, in which knowledge is represented in the form of rules.
Last topic under the fundamental topics of the course:  Semantic Networks, Generate and Test, Production Systems, Means-End Analysis, and Problem Reduction

Will talk about cognitive architecture, in general, and focus on production systems then talk about a mechanism of learning called chunking

## Exercise: A Pitcher

How might intelligent agents make complex decisions about the world?
Given that David has a lot of knowledge about baseball, he can use that knowledge to make a decision.
How is her using his knowledge to make a decision?  What is the architecture?  What is the reasoning that leads him to make that specific decision?

## Function of a Cognitive Architecture

Percepts -> Action.  Maps a particular history into an action.  What should we do next?

## Levels of Cognitive Architectures

Task / Knowledge Level (e.g. selecting a pitch, playing baseball)

Algorithm / Symbol Level (e.g. means-ends analysis, semantic networks)

Hardware / Implmentation Level (e.g. a brain, a transistor)

David Mark talked about 3 levels which he called computational theory. the level of algorithms and the level of implementation.

The three levels are transitive for architectures:  Hardware/Impl Level is an architecture for Algorithm/Symbol Level.  Algorith/Symbol Level is an architecture for Task/Knowledge Level.

In reverse, the three levels are content for another:  Task/Knowledge Level is content for Algorithm/Symbol Level.  Algorithm/Symbol Level is content for Hardware/Impl Level.

Semantic network is represented by Knowledge Level.  What is the content of the knowledge in order to do a particular task.

Want to build theories at all three of these different levels of abstractions.

Most of AI work is done at the top two levels.
